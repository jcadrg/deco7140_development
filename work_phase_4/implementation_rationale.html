          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Alignment with Client and User Needs</h3>
            <p>
              The implementation phase expanded significantly on the original
              niche concept of a hobby-sharing platform. Initial ideas were
              oriented toward project galleries and passive browsing. However,
              based on feedback gathered through persona development (e.g. the
              retired crafter, the bookstagrammer mom, and the urban drone
              racer), the design evolved to support more dynamic, inclusive, and
              community-driven use cases. These personas emphasized the need for
              encouragement, emotional safety, and easy interaction—especially
              for users with varied digital confidence levels or limited time
              availability.
            </p>
            <p>
              As implementation progressed, however, the target audience
              underwent a major shift. Reflecting insights from peer testing and
              iterative design reflection (Reflection Notebook, pp. 3–6), the
              platform transitioned toward a more focused demographic:
              tech-savvy DIY creators interested in structured learning,
              showcasing, and collaboration. This pivot was driven by
              feasibility concerns and the recognition that a more technically
              engaged audience would better suit the scope and capabilities of
              the project. Consequently, original personas were retired, and
              features were redesigned to support maker-oriented use cases—such
              as circuits tutorials, 3D printing workflows, and project-based
              learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              These shifts directly align with the Connect Communities
              Initiative (CCI), which prioritizes creativity, belonging, and
              equitable access across digital experiences. For instance, the
              homepage was rewritten using plain, inclusive language that
              promotes a sense of belonging rather than achievement pressure
              (e.g. “where your passions belong” instead of “where your passions
              matter”). This follows WCAG 3.1.1 for readability and aligns with
              inclusive design recommendations from the Australian Government
              Style Manual and CCI guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Structurally, the site now supports multiple pathways for user
              interaction—such as project creation, group discovery, and profile
              personalization—based on research indicating users prefer
              platforms that support both expression and exploration (Reflection
              Notebook, pp. 3–6). These features also reflect CCI’s emphasis on
              low-pressure participation, ensuring that even new or less
              confident users feel empowered to contribute.

              Accessibility and Ethical Considerations
            </h3>
            <p>
              Accessibility principles guided every aspect of the platform’s
              development. This included the use of semantic HTML5 elements
              (e.g. <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>), visible focus indicators for keyboard
              navigation, and responsive feedback mechanisms on form inputs. All
              colors were chosen to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios,
              particularly the recurring purple and pink tones used for calls to
              action and headers (WCAG 1.4.3). Typography and spacing were
              defined using rem units and CSS variables to ensure scalable
              legibility across devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethical considerations were also embedded throughout the design
              process. These included avoiding language that could stereotype
              users based on gender, age, or ability; designing forms without
              intrusive data collection; and ensuring users could browse and
              contribute without mandatory login or exposure to algorithmic
              ranking. The inclusive writing style was modeled on the Australian
              Government Style Manual and prioritized warmth, clarity, and
              neutrality.
            </p>
            <p>
              These principles reflect the values of the Connect Communities
              Initiative (CCI), which encourages inclusive digital design as a
              pathway to creative empowerment. The team regularly cross-checked
              the interface against WCAG criteria using tools like IBM Equal
              Access Checker and followed internal checklists during development
              sprints to verify ethical and accessibility alignment (Reflection
              Notebook, p. 4–5).

            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h3>
            <p>
              Several key deviations from the A3 design proposal emerged during
              implementation, reflecting a shift in project scope, target
              audience, and interaction model. Initially envisioned as a
              general-purpose hobby-sharing platform, the site pivoted to focus
              on a tech-savvy DIY audience after deeper persona analysis and
              peer feedback (Reflection Notebook, p. 3–6). This shift resulted
              in discarding the original personas (e.g., retired crafter,
              bookstagrammer mom) in favor of new ones such as electronics
              hobbyists, 3D printing enthusiasts, and open-source hardware
              creators.
            </p>
            <p>
              These changes impacted not only the visual language of the
              site—introducing bolder UI elements, streamlined navigation, and
              more technical vocabulary—but also structural decisions such as
              collapsing redundant categories (e.g. merging “Projects” and
              “Tutorials” into a unified card-based feed). The homepage was
              revised to promote exploration, rather than showcasing pre-set
              categories or curated highlights, based on insights suggesting
              that tech creators value discovery and peer-driven visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several UI components proposed in A3 (such as animated onboarding
              sequences and hover-state tooltips) were either removed or
              simplified due to implementation feasibility and timeline
              constraints. Similarly, some visual elements were adapted or
              replaced—such as the change in button size and layout hierarchy—to
              improve clarity and align with modular CSS practices introduced
              later in development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these adjustments, the final product remains aligned with
              the goals and values outlined in A3. Each change was supported by
              peer review, user observation, or feasibility assessment. The
              iterative design process was anchored by the values of the Connect
              Communities Initiative, particularly around reducing participation
              barriers and promoting sustainable, expressive tech-focused
              communities.

            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Challenges and Strategies</h3>
            <p>
              The implementation phase posed several technical and design
              challenges that required adaptive strategies and iterative
              problem-solving. One major issue was handling dynamic data parsing
              for user content. Originally, project and creator information were
              hardcoded, but to improve maintainability and simulate real-world
              functionality, the site was restructured to pull this data from
              modular JavaScript files (e.g., <code>filters.js</code>,
              <code>details.js</code>). This not only reduced redundancy but
              also laid the foundation for scalability in a potential live
              environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the front-end, layout inconsistencies across devices were
              discovered late in development, particularly in margin spacing and
              component alignment. These were resolved using CSS variables and
              flexbox-based layout refinements that ensure responsiveness while
              preserving aesthetic consistency. Components such as the floating
              detail card were made mobile-friendly through viewport-aware
              positioning and scaling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethically, tone and inclusion presented an ongoing concern.
              Several text blocks and prompts were revised to remove jargon,
              gendered language, or anything that could be interpreted as
              gatekeeping or exclusionary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, challenges were met with modular, scalable solutions that
              balanced time constraints with design integrity. Continuous peer
              feedback, reflection logs, and audit tools (e.g., Equal Access
              Checker) played a critical role in ensuring progress remained
              aligned with the platform’s inclusive and user-focused goals.

              The <strong>“My Hub”</strong> page includes working
              implementations of both <code>GET</code> and
              <code>POST</code> methods to interact with the community API.
            </p>
            <p class="m-t-2">
              When a user adds or edits their profile information, a
              <code>POST</code> request is triggered to submit the updated data
              to the backend endpoint. These actions occur through form
              submission buttons tied to authenticated users.
            </p>
            <p class="m-t-2">
              Additionally, a <code>GET</code> request is automatically
              performed every time the page loads or refreshes. This ensures
              that the most recent data is fetched and displayed immediately
              when the user visits their profile dashboard.
            </p>
            <p class="m-t-2">
              All data operations were tested to ensure correct field bindings,
