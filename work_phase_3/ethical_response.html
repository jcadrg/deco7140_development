          <p class="m-b-4">
            Throughout the design of HobbyHub, ethical decision-making has been intentionally integrated into every phase. The goal is to build a platform that not only functions well, but is inclusive, respectful, and aligned with the values and lived experiences of real users.

            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Inclusivity</h3>
            <p>
              Our site design emphasizes inclusivity by using accessible language, welcoming visuals, and tone-appropriate messaging. The UI elements were selected to reflect diverse user needs, including those with limited tech confidence. From our choice of accessible color contrasts and font sizes to community-centered imagery and low-pressure calls to action, inclusivity is central to our interaction strategy.

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Cultural Sensitivity</h3>
            <p>
              Reflective design decisions intentionally represent a variety of user experiences and backgrounds. Imagery, language, and tone were selected based on real user personas and interviews. We deliberately avoided stereotypes and ensured that our visual and textual content promotes respect, shared experiences, and celebration of creative diversity.

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Data Privacy</h3>
            <p>
              All forms and data collection mechanisms are clearly labeled, transparent, and designed with minimum data retention. Form submission endpoints include visible user feedback, and we avoid collecting unnecessary personal information. This approach aligns with user concerns around safety, trust, and platform transparency, particularly for older and more privacy-conscious users.

            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Linked to Client and User Research</h3>
            <p>
              These ethical practices directly stem from our A2 user interviews and client brief analysis. We prioritize respectful communication, flexible engagement levels, and transparency, reinforcing CCI‚Äôs mission to build meaningful, low-pressure online communities.
