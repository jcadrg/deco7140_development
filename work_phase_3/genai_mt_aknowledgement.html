            Generative AI tools were used throughout the design process to enhance creativity, problem-solving, and productivity. All AI contributions were reviewed, edited, and integrated intentionally to support human-led decision-making. Below are specific areas where GenAI supported the project:
          </p>

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Imagery & Visual Reference</h3>
            <p>
              AI assisted in brainstorming ideas for imagery and layout inspiration. While no AI-generated images were directly used in the final designs, AI helped with structuring creative direction, exploring visual language, and supporting the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of cards and page layouts.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Language & Wording</h3>
            <p>
              GenAI provided support drafting microcopy, button text, form messages, and alternate tone suggestions. This helped align content with inclusive language and client-identified values like encouragement, safety, and belonging.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Code Support & Debugging</h3>
            <p>
              Assistance included structuring CSS layouts, writing modular HTML, refining JavaScript interactions (such as accordion toggles, gallery viewers, and form feedback), and debugging errors. All code was human-verified, tested, and adapted to fit our accessibility and aesthetic standards.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Creative Structuring</h3>
            <p>
              AI contributed to planning the architecture of pages (e.g. homepage sections, card layouts, wireframe flow) and suggesting best practices for information hierarchy and responsive UX across devices. All choices were refined collaboratively and implemented with design intent.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="ethics-block m-b-4">
            <h3 class="ethics-heading">Final Note</h3>
            <p>
              At no point did GenAI make design decisions independently. It served as a creative collaborator and productivity tool ‚Äî enabling iteration, reflection, and better time management in a complex and multi-layered design process.
