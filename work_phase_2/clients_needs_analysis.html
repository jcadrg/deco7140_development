          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering social
            cohesion by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
            connect with others, and access resources that enhance their
            visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds
            by creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique identities
            of communities across Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams at Connect
            Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is tasked with
            developing individual concepts and prototypes for dynamic websites
            that align with CCI‚Äôs mission and vision. Our mission is to strengthen
            societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and support the
            unique identities of communities across Australia.
          </p>
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            We are commissioning the development of dynamic, user-friendly
            websites that represent and support different communities. Each
            website should serve as a central hub where community members can
            share resources, highlight events, and foster meaningful connections.
            The websites must not include any form of commercial activity, such as
            advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable to promote
            resources, events, or services that are directly beneficial to the
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and reflect the
            diverse needs of the selected community focus area while adhering to
            our mission of inclusivity, accessibility, and ethical design. Each
            website should also celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen
            community and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
          </p>
          <h3>Community Focus Areas</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cultural and Heritage Communities</li>
            <li>Academic and Professional Communities</li>
            <li>Wellness and Mental Health Communities</li>
            <li>Social and Environmental Advocacy Communities</li>
            <li>Regional or International Communities</li>
            <li>Creative Arts and Media Communities</li>
            <li>Lived Experience Communities</li>
            <li>Food and Culinary Communities</li>
            <li>Tech and Innovation Communities</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Additional Information</h3>
          <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
          <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Community Members: Individuals within the selected community who
              seek representation, resources, and connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              General Audience: Broader society, who can use the website to learn
              about the community and its contributions.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless interaction for
            all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen community,
              recognising and representing the diversity within the community
              rather than relying on stereotypes.
            </li>
            <li>Provide clear, accessible information and resources to users.</li>
            <li>
              Foster meaningful connections and support within the community.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive design
              principles are upheld.
            </li>
